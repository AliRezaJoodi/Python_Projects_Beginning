It's my solutions for **Age Calculator**.

### Assignment
To create an age calculator, you need two dates:
- today’s date
- date of birth
You only Ask for the birthday. So use datetime module for today’s date. 

### Development
I created some files for modular programming. They are including:
- **display.py** (Display everything and usable for debug.)
- **age_calculator.py** (Code for main Tasks.)
- **main.py** (Calling  and  management functions.) 

### Output
