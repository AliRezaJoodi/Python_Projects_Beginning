It's my solutions for **Find Missing Number**.

### Assignment
There is an array containing a range of numbers from 1 to n with few missing numbers, First sort, then find the missing numbers in the array.
For example:
```
Orginal List:    [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
Missing Numbers: [4, 12, 15]
```

### Development
I'll Write the code in `Find_Missing_Number.py`. For development, then can use `Main.py` to test my function.

### Output
It's my solutions output:
```
Function:              find_missing_number
numbers (Orginal):     [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
numbers (Sort):        [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
max_number:            16
visualization_numbers: [1, 2, 3, '-', 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, '-', 13, 14, '-', 16]
missing_numbers:       [4, 12, 15]


Missing Numbers:       [4, 12, 15]
```
