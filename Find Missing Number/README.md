It's my solutions for **Find Missing Number**.

### Assignment
There is an array containing a range of numbers from 1 to n with few missing numbers, First sort, then find the missing numbers in the array.
For example:
```
Orginal List:    [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
Missing Numbers: [4, 12, 15]
```

### Development
I created some files for modular programming. They are including:
- **display.py** (Display everything and usable for debug.)
- **find_missing_number.py** (Code for main Tasks.)
- **main.py** (Calling  and  management functions.) 

### Output
It's my solutions output:
```
Function:              find_missing_number
numbers (Orginal):     [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
numbers (Sort):        [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
max_number:            16
visualization_numbers: [1, 2, 3, '-', 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, '-', 13, 14, '-', 16]
missing_numbers:       [4, 12, 15]


Orginal Numbers:       [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
Missing Numbers:       [4, 12, 15]
