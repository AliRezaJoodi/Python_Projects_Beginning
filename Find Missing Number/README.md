It's my solutions for **Find Missing Number**.

### Assignment
There is an array containing a range of numbers from 1 to n with few missing numbers, find the missing numbers in the array.
For example:
```
Orginal List:    [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
Missing Numbers: [4, 12, 15]
```
