It's my **Python Programming** exercises.

I will find ideas or projects for programming exercise. I'll first try to do it myself without refer to the source code. If I can't do it, So refer to the code for understanding, then try again.

I'll write source link for thanks and refer.

There are many sources for using. For example:
- [Python Projects with Source Code. Beginner & Advanced](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/01/14/python-projects-with-source-code)
- [Python Practice Questions for Coding Interviews](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/07/15/python-practice-questions-for-coding-interviews/)
