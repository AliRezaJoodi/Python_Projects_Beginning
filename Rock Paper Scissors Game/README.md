It's my solutions for **Rock Paper Scissors Game**.

### Assignment
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people. In this game, scissors can beat paper, paper can beat rock, and rock can beat scissors.
In this program, Player-1 will be the user, and player-2 will be the computer. Player one will manually select the rock paper or scissor, while player-2 will choose randomly. So you will also use the random module in Python to create this game.
Game will repeat until press exit key_'E' or 'e'. It shows total score then will exit.

### Development
I created some files for modular programming. They are including:
- **display.py** (Display everything and usable for debug.)
- **rock_paper_scissors_game.py** (Code for main Tasks.)
- **main.py** (Calling  and  management functions.)
