It's about **Number Guessing Game using Python**.

### Description
To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 to 10. Then take a number from the user.
To give hints to the user, we can use conditional statements to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, greater than or equal to the randomly selected number.
